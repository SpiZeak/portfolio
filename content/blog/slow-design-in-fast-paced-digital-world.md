Our engineering team spans Sweden, Australia, and North America. Early on we ran stand-ups, planning, and retros in ways that worked for one time zone but exhausted everyone else. After a few painful sprints we redesigned the process. Here is what keeps us shipping without burning out.

## Asynchronous first

Every sprint begins with written context. Product briefs, acceptance criteria, and open questions live in Notion and Linear so people in different time zones can respond before we meet. Daily updates happen in a thread where engineers post blockers and demos. When someone needs live help we jump on a call, but async is the default.

## Time-boxed rituals that respect calendars

Planning happens twice per sprint: a 30-minute backlog refinement mid-week and a 45-minute planning call to lock scope. Stand-ups are optional unless you have a blocker. Retrospectives take 25 minutes with the format decided by whoever hosts that week.

## Shared visibility into the work

We rely on GitHub pull requests and preview environments, not meeting recaps. Every PR template includes testing notes, screenshots, and risk callouts. Stakeholders watch demos recorded with Loom, then leave comments before the sprint review. This keeps everyone accountable even when they cannot attend live sessions.

## Guardrails that keep the team healthy

No deployment happens without a second pair of eyes. We track on-call hours and rotate weekly so nobody is stuck responding to alerts every night. Engineers block focus time on their calendars and we protect itâ€”slack pings are for emergencies, not status.

The result: happier teammates, predictable releases, and the confidence to take on larger projects. If you are wrangling a distributed team and want templates or facilitation tips, send me a note.
