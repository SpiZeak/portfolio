Over the past few years I've been responsible for taking the Osolo Consultant Group client onboarding portal from an initial brief to a reliable production platform. The stack mixes React, TypeScript, Node.js, and WordPress. This article documents the exact steps we follow, including the guardrails that keep the build shippable even as requirements shift.

## 1. Discovery and technical audit

Before writing code we sit down with stakeholders to understand why the current flow breaks down. Customer success needed a single place to manage onboarding checklists, while marketing wanted to update copy without filing tickets. I inventory existing systems, note every API touchpoint, and sketch a lean architecture diagram. For this project that meant proxying data from a legacy CRM while exposing content through the WordPress REST API.

Success metrics were clear: reduce manual onboarding time by 30%, give non-technical teams a way to adjust messaging, and keep support response times under five minutes. Writing these targets down early lets us prove value later.

## 2. Architecture and foundations

I start new features from the infrastructure level: linting, testing, Storybook, CI, and deployment pipelines. Our portal runs on a React + TypeScript front-end with server-rendered Node.js endpoints. We lean on Vite for local feedback, Playwright for end-to-end assertions, and GitHub Actions for continuous delivery.

On the content side we extend WordPress with custom post types and a lightweight plugin that gives marketing a structured UI. Clear naming, field validation, and preview endpoints prevent surprises when someone updates copy minutes before a release.

## 3. Iterative implementation

We slice work into thin vertical increments. Each sprint includes:

- A Storybook component or UI flow with documented states
- A Node.js route or queue worker that hides integration complexity
- Playwright coverage for critical paths and unit tests for data transforms

Code reviews focus on maintainability: accessible semantics, performance budgets, and clear abstractions. Pair programming helps untangle edge cases and keeps context shared across the team.

## 4. Harden with quality gates

Every pull request runs through linting, tests, type checks, and Lighthouse performance budgets. We deploy to staging on each merge and demo functionality during the weekly stakeholder review. Customer success sees features before they ship, which keeps rework low.

## 5. Launch and iterate

On release day we use feature flags to gradually enable new experiences, watching logs and analytics dashboards in real time. Post-launch, a 30-minute retrospective captures what went well and what needs tightening. We log follow-up tasks directly in the backlog and schedule performance sweeps once a month.

## Results

Since adopting this flow the onboarding portal reduced manual setup time by 37%, cut duplicate support tickets in half, and gave marketing the ability to ship updates without engineering support. The structure outlined above now serves as our template for new client portals.
