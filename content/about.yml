  Hi, I'm **Max Trewhitt**, a full-stack developer based in Sweden with Australian-Swedish citizenship. Since 2018 I've been delivering web applications for **Osolo Consultant Group**, pairing React and TypeScript front-ends with Node.js services and custom WordPress builds that give marketing teams the flexibility they need.

  ### What I'm focused on right now

  At Osolo I lead agile squads that ship production features for B2B clients—from responsive dashboards to content-managed marketing sites. My role spans planning sprint work, pairing with designers, reviewing pull requests, and keeping a close eye on performance budgets and accessibility standards.

  ### Previous experience

  Before stepping into my current role I built custom WordPress plugins and performance optimisations during an internship at **Lightweb**, and delivered a React + Redux single-page application for **Vinnovera's Robotkodarn** program where Arduino code compiled in the browser and streamed to classroom devices.

  ### Education

  I earned an **Advanced Diploma in Front-End Development** from **KYH** (2016–2018) and completed a **University Preparatory Exam at Cybergymnasiet** with a focus on programming, media technology, and web development. That mix of creative problem solving and technical rigour still shapes how I approach every build.

  ### Outside of commits

  I'm usually experimenting with new JavaScript tooling, sharing best practices with my team, or exploring the Swedish countryside with a camera. Staying connected with family in Australia keeps my perspective broad and my collaboration style flexible across time zones.
